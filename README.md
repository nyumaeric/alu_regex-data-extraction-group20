# Data Extraction Using Regular Expressions

This project is part of the ALU Hackathon for extracting specific data types from raw API responses using regular expressions. We have implemented the data extraction using Python.

## Data Types Extracted

1. **Restaurant Name and Cuisine Type**
   - Example: Restaurant - Italian

2. **Ingredients List from Recipes**
   - Example: Tomato, Basil, Mozzarella

3. **Background Color in RGB**
   - Example: rgb(255, 0, 0)

4. **Social Media Link**
   - Example: Visit us on Twitter: [@alu_regex-data-extraction-group20](https://twitter.com/alu_regex-data-extraction-group20)

5. **Product Code**
   - Example: XYZ456

6. **News Headline**
   - Example: Breaking News - Major Event

7. **Event Date and Time**
   - Example: Oct 03, 2023 - 03:30 PM

## Implementation

We have used Python to implement the data extraction. In the source code, you will find regular expressions corresponding to each data type. The extracted data is then processed as needed.
